Gapminder data frame contains just 6 columns from the larger data in Gapminder World. In this part, we shall join a few dataframes with more data than the ‘gapminder’ package. Specifically, let's look at data on

* Life expectancy at birth (life_expectancy_years.csv)
* GDP per capita in constant 2010 US$ (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)
* Female fertility: The number of babies per woman (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)
* Primary school enrollment as % of children attending primary school (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.NENR)
* Mortality rate, for under 5, per 1000 live births (https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT)
* HIV prevalence (adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv): The estimated number of people living with HIV per 100 population of age group 15-49.

```{r}
library(gapminder)
skim(gapminder)
```

```{r}
# load gapminder HIV data
hiv <- read_csv(here::here("data","adults_with_hiv_percent_age_15_49.csv"))
life_expectancy <- read_csv(here::here("data","life_expectancy_years.csv"))

# get World bank data using wbstats
indicators <- c("SP.DYN.TFRT.IN","SE.PRM.NENR", "SH.DYN.MORT", "NY.GDP.PCAP.KD")


library(wbstats)

worldbank_data <- wb_data(country="countries_only", #countries only- no aggregates like Latin America, Europe, etc.
                          indicator = indicators, 
                          start_date = 1960, 
                          end_date = 2016)

# get a dataframe of information regarding countries, indicators, sources, regions, indicator topics, lending types, income levels,  from the World Bank API 
countries <-  wbstats::wb_cachelist$countries

```

Left Join makes the most sense among the different types of join operations like outer joins - left, right, and full. This is because a left join operation (regardless of there being a match) preserves the original observations, especially when one looks up additional data from another table. Since, we are working with 3 dataframes, while mapping the year and date column with different start/end time frames, it is essential to preserve the original observations in each dataframe.

```{r}
# tidying HIV data - hiv and life_expectancy dataframes - using pivot_longer() + remving NA values
hiv1 <- hiv %>%
  pivot_longer(2:34, names_to = "year", values_to = "Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49") %>% 
  drop_na()
skim(hiv1)
```

```{r}
life_expectancy_1 <- life_expectancy %>%
  pivot_longer(2:302, names_to = "year", values_to = "Life_Expectancy") %>% 
  drop_na()
skim(life_expectancy_1)
```



```{r}
#Removing NA values in worldbank_data
worldbank_data_1 <- worldbank_data %>%
  drop_na()
skim(worldbank_data_1)
```

```{r}
#Left Join of life_expectancy_1 (tidied life_expectancy) and hiv1 (tidied hiv) dataframes 
join_1 <- left_join(life_expectancy_1, hiv1, by = c("country"="country", "year"="year"))
# Converting datatype of column (year) from character type to numeric type
join_1$year = as.numeric(join_1$year)
```

```{r}
#Left Join of join_1 (left join of hiv1 and life_expectancy_1 dataframes) and worldbank_data dataframes
join_2 <- left_join(join_1, worldbank_data_1, by = c("country"="country", "year"="date"))
```

```{r}
#Left Join of join_1 (left join of hiv1 and life_expectancy_1 dataframes) and worldbank_data dataframes
join_3 <- left_join(join_2, countries, "country"="country") %>%
  drop_na()
join_3
```

What is the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy? 

Based on the scatterplot with a smoothing line, it seems like region plays a role in the relationship between HIV prevalence and life expectancy. HIV Prevalence is depicted through the percentage of HIV cases in the age group 15-49 years. In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa, there is a definite pattern of a negative slope which implies that as HIV prevalence increases, there is a decrease in Life Expectancy. In Latin America too, there is a negative slope implying an inverse relationship between HIV prevalence and Life Expectancy. However, there is more variability in the plot for Sub-Saharan Africa as compared to Latin America.

```{r}
#Scatterplot for Life Expectancy vs. HIV prevalence 
ggplot(join_3, aes(x = Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49, y = Life_Expectancy)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.3) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ region) +
    labs(title = "Relationship between HIV Prevalence and Life Expectancy", 
         x = "HIV Prevalence",
         y = "Life Expectancy")
```

What is the relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita? 

Based on the scatterplot with a smoothing line, it seems like facetting by region solidifies the belief that all regions depict an inverse relationship between fertility rate and GDP per capita. In the case of Sub-Saharan Africa in particular, as the fertility rate increases, the GDP per capita decreases. The inverse relationship between the two variables demonstrates the connection between fertility choices and economic considerations. In general, developing or low-income countries tend to have higher levels of fertility than their developed counterparts for several reasons such as infant mortality, lack of access to contraceptives, generally lower levels of female education, etc.

```{r}
ggplot(join_3, aes(x = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN, y = NY.GDP.PCAP.KD)) +
    geom_point(size = 0.5) +
    geom_smooth(method="lm") +
    facet_wrap(~ region) +
    labs(title = "Relationship between Fertility Rate and GDP per capita", 
         x = "Fertility Rate",
         y = "GDP per capita")+
  NULL
```

Which regions have the most observations with missing HIV data? 

Region ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’ has the most observations with missing HIV data. This is followed by Europe & Central Asia with the 2nd most observations with missing HIV data.

```{r}
#Tidying hiv dataframe
tidy_hiv <- hiv %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols=2:34, names_to="year", values_to = "Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49")
#Left joining tidy_hiv and countries dataframes
joined_hiv_countries <- left_join(tidy_hiv, countries, "country"= "country")
joined_hiv_countries
```

```{r}
# Determining NA values in joined_hiv_countries dataframe
joined_hiv_countries %>%
  filter(!is.na(region)) %>%
  group_by(region) %>%
  summarise(missing_hiv_values=sum(is.na(Percentage_HIV_Cases_Age_15_49))) %>%
  mutate(
    region=fct_reorder(region,-missing_hiv_values)) %>%
# Plotting Bar Chart of Region Specific Missing HIV Data in Descending Order
  ggplot(aes(x=missing_hiv_values,y=region))+
  geom_col(fill = "coral")+
  labs(title="Bar Chart of Region Specific Missing HIV Data in Descending Order",
    x= "Missing NA values in HIV data",
    y= "Region"
  )

How has mortality rate for under 5 changed by region? 
In each region, the top 5 countries that have seen the greatest improvement, as well as those 5 countries where mortality rates have had the least improvement or even deterioration, have been determined.

```{r}
#Minimum Year and Maximum Year determination
mortality <- join_3 %>% 
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarise(minimum_year=min(year), maximum_year=max(year))
mortality
```

```{r}

join_5 <- left_join(join_3, mortality, "country"="country") %>% #Left Joining join_3 and mortality dataframes
select(country, year, minimum_year, maximum_year, SH.DYN.MORT, region) %>% # Selecting required columns
mutate(
  original_mortality = ifelse(year == minimum_year, SH.DYN.MORT, 0)) %>% #Determining original mortality rates
select(!year) %>%
filter(!original_mortality == 0)%>%
select(!SH.DYN.MORT)

join_5
```

```{r}

Is there a relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate? 

Yes, there seems to be a strong inverse relationship between primary school enrollment and fertility rate. We would desire to see a distribution of values like in Europe&Central Asia, where there is a very high percentage of people completing primary education and the higher this percentage, the lower the mortality rate. We can observe a similar pattern for Latin America & Caribbean. In South Asia, the countries have very diverse percentages of population having completed primary education, as does Sub-Saharan Africa. In the latter and in East Asia&Pacific, we also observe an inverse trend: we seem to find an increased mortality rate for countries with higher percentage of population having completed primary education. 

```{r}
ggplot(join_3, aes(x = SE.PRM.NENR, y = SP.DYN.TFRT.IN)) +
    geom_point() +

Secondly, GDP is the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption C), Gross Capital Formation (business investment I), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports). Even though there is an indicator Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in your dataframe, let's calculate it given its components discussed above.
```{r}
#converting to tidy wide format 
tidy_GDP_data_2 <- tidy_GDP_data_1%>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = IndicatorName, 
    values_from = indicator_data)
glimpse(tidy_GDP_data_2)
```

```{r}
# Using GDP formula to calculate GDP using GDP components - the sum of Household Expenditure (Consumption *C*), Gross Capital Formation (business investment *I*), Government Expenditure (G) and Net Exports (exports - imports)
tidy_GDP_data_2 <- tidy_GDP_data_2 %>%
  mutate(calculated_GDP = tidy_GDP_data_2$`Household expenditure`+ tidy_GDP_data_2$`Gross capital formation`+ tidy_GDP_data_2$`Government expenditure`+ tidy_GDP_data_2$`Exports`- tidy_GDP_data_2$`Imports`)
#Calculating % difference between calculated GDP and UN_GDP_data GDP Figures
tidy_GDP_data_2 <- tidy_GDP_data_2 %>%
  mutate(percentage_difference_calculatedGDP_columnGDP = (((calculated_GDP / tidy_GDP_data_2$`Gross Domestic Product (GDP)`)-1) * 100))

tidy_GDP_data_2
```

```{r}
# Plotting a graph, utilizing Percentage Difference of Calculated GDP and UN_GDP_data GDP Figures to compare this difference across Germany, India, and United States
tidy_GDP_data_2 %>%
  filter(Country %in% country_list) %>%

What is the % difference between calculated GDP and the GDP figure included in the dataframe?
In the case of India, the period 1970-1990, the graph depicts a yellow region wherein calculated GDP is higher than the UN_GDP_data GDP figures. However, post 1990 (excluding 2007 and 2010), the graph depicts a blue region wherein calculated GDP is lower than the UN_GDP_data GDP figures. In 2007, the % difference between calculated GDP and the GDP figure is 2.1309% and in 2010, the % difference between calculated GDP and the GDP figure is 1.0660%

In the case of Germany, the graph depicts a yellow region throughout from 1970 to 2017 wherein calculated GDP is higher than the UN_GDP_data GDP figures.The % difference between calculated GDP and the GDP figure was maximum in 1972 at 3.56%. In the United States, the graph depicts a mostly yellow region i.e.calculated GDP is higher than the UN_GDP_data GDP figures, excluding the time period from 2005-2008, 2010, and 2016-2017 which depicted a blue region i.e. calculated GDP is lower than the UN_GDP_data GDP figures.
